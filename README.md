# Personal-Site
First attempt at a personal resume website. 

## :blue_book: About:
- I will be updating and redesigning this site as my skills develop. 

## :dart: Planning:
- Index Page, basic info, minimilist, personal statement
- Resume Page: work history etc.
- GitHub: Projects showcase
- Find a host :battery:

## :wrench: Tools:
- Sinatra :microphone:
- Ruby :gem:
- My aim will be to switch over to a different framework using JS. Currently using Sinatra + Ruby so this is what I'll start with. 

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: More to come!
